How It Works:
User Input: The program first prompts the user to enter their name and three favorite numbers.
Even/Odd Check: Each number is checked to determine if it is even or odd, and this information is stored in a list of tuples.
Square Calculation: The program then calculates the square of each number and displays it in a creative format.
Sum Calculation: The sum of the three numbers is calculated and printed with an encouraging message.
Prime Check: The program checks if the sum is a prime number and informs the user.
This interactive tool should provide a fun and informative way for your friend to explore their favorite numbers!
